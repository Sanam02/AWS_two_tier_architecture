## üñ•Ô∏è Installation of Terraform
### Create S3 Backend Bucket
Create an S3 bucket to store the .tfstate file in the remote backend
**Warning** It is highly recommended that you `enable Bucket Versioning` on the S3 bucket to allow for state recovery in the case of accidental deletions and human error.
**Note** We will need this bucket name in the later step
### Create a DynamoDB table for state file locking
- Give the table a name
- make sure to add a `Partition key` with name `LockID` and type as `String`

### Generate a public-private key pair for our instances
We need a public key and private key for our server so please follow the procedure I've included below.

```sh
cd modules/key/
ssh-keygen
```
The aove command asks for the key name and then gives `client_key` it will create pair of keys one public and one private. You can give any name you want but then you need to edit the Terraform file

Edit the blow file according to your configuration
```sh
vim root/backend.tf
```
Add the blow code in root/backend.tf
